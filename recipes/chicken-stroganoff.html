        <p>
          <strong>  Chicken Stroganoff</strong> is a Brazilian adaptation of the original stroganoff recipe is actually Russian!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong> The original version of the dish</strong> was made with saut√©ed pieces of beef and sour cream. <br>
          Since its creation, the original recipe has become popular all over the world, and each countries'variaton <br>
          of the recipe can differ significantly from the original.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some recipes like to cut the beef into strips rather than cubes, others will use some kind of alcohol, <br>
          somethings vegetables are added to mix, and even pickles are found in some recipes! Different variations will <br>
          use a different blend of seasonings, too...and depending on wich version you try, it can be served over pasta, <br>
          potatoes or rice. I don't know about you, but I'm down to try them all.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Brazil, we love strogonoff so much that in addition to chicken stroganoff, we have two other variations:beef, and shrimp. <br>
          And we almost serve it over white rice with potato sticks <em>(batata palha)</strong> sprinkled on top. <br>
          But it's also very common to serve it over a baked potato, too.
