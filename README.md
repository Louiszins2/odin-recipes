# My first recipe site

This is my first project on odin project.

I'm learning HTML and how to commit my works, in this project I'll build a recipes website to test my knowledge. 

In this project I learned how to make, optimize and use the main structure of HTML, I know that this site can have a more friendly appearance, but
I decided not to use css , because it's more difficult to just use HTML, so I wanted to take on this challenge. I put all the credits for the recipes, I hope you like my first project!!! xD
